# Tinder Carousel

Create a tinder like carousel to swipe left and right random people.
Every card in the app, has the details of person with person&#39;s image on top and icons on
bottom, name and other info from the api.
If I swipe left I get the details of the next person from the API.
At the bottom there are multiple icons on touch the information changes.
The user whom I swiped right should be stored as favourite.
My favourite list of people should be available offline also.
